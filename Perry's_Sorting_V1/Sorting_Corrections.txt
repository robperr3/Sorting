To translate your insertion sort to use your linked list instead of an array or vector, you would need to make modifications such as the following: for (unsigned int i = 1; i < l.size(); i++) would become for (auto i = head->next; i != nullptr; i = i->next) { // inner loop } The problem you had with the STL sorting implementation is that you were attempting to call it on your Doubly Linked List. Unfotrunately, you cannot use the STL sorting implementation to sort your linked list for a couple reasons 1) the STL doesn't know how to compare two node objects, and 2) STL sort requires the ability to access a value at any place quickly (think index). To get the STL sort algorithm to work with the vector you created, you would do the following: vector <int> second_vector = { 7,4,5,2,15,12,29,96,46,75,24,95,46,75,24,13,68,74,57,809,96,54,55,33,22 }; sort(second_vector.begin(), second_vector.end());
